                  <p className="mt-3">
                    One of the best exercises at home for targeting the triceps
                    is the triceps dip on a chair. This simple yet effective
                    move focuses on extending the elbow and forearm, making it a
                    top choice for strengthening the triceps muscles located on
                    the rear of your upper arms. Regularly performing this
                    exercise can significantly improve your upper body strength.
                    Repeat 2-3 times each day, and you'll notice visible results
                    in no time. <br />

                        When it comes to how to workout at home effectively,
                        bodyweight squats should be a staple. They hit your legs
                        hard, engaging multiple muscles simultaneously and
                        stimulating growth. This exercise is crucial for weight
                        loss as it not only builds muscle but also increases
                        overall strength.

                      <li>
                        Start with a low step height and focus on proper form.
                        Keeping your back straight and your abdominal muscles
                        tight will ensure you get the most out of your squats.
                        Incorporating bodyweight squats into your routine can
                        enhance your lower body conditioning.

                        Abdominal crunches are a fundamental exercise at home
                        for building core strength. The core encompasses more
                        than just your abs; it includes your oblique muscles and
                        lower back. Performing crunches regularly will improve
                        your core stability, which is crucial for overall
                        fitness.
