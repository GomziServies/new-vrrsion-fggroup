                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Diabetes type two may be a lifelong condition that impacts
                    how your body processes insulin, a hormone that regulates
                    blood sugar. This form of Diabetes is commonly associated
                    with insulin resistance, meaning the body cannot use insulin
                    efficiently. While diabetes type two often develops later in
                    life, it's becoming more prevalent in younger populations
                    due to factors like childhood obesity and poor diet.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Diabetes type two was once known as non-insulin-dependent
                    diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Today, with rising cases among
                    younger people, it is more frequently diagnosed in children
                    and teenagers. Still, older adults, particularly those over
                    45, remain the most affected group by Diabetes type two.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In the U.S. alone, approximately 29 million people have
                    diabetes type two, while another 84 million have
                    prediabetesâ€”a condition in which blood sugar is higher than
                    normal but not yet in the diabetic range. Addressing this
                    stage early could prevent the onset of diabetes type two.

                    What are diabetes symptoms? Often, diabetes symptoms can be
                    mild and easy to overlook. It's not uncommon for people to
                    live with diabetes type two for years before it's diagnosed.
                    Below are some of the most common indicators of Diabetes:

                  <p className="mt-3">
                    The main issue behind Diabetes type two is insulin
                    resistance. Insulin, produced by the pancreas, helps your
                    cells convert glucose (sugar) into energy. With diabetes
                    type two, your body produces insulin, but your cells don't
                    use it as they should. This forces your pancreas to make
                    extra insulin to compensate. Over time, it may struggle to
                    keep up, leading to elevated blood sugar levels, a hallmark
                    of Diabetes.

                    To confirm if you have diabetes type two, your doctor will
                    perform several tests. One of the most common is the A1c
                    test, which gives an average of your blood sugar levels over
                    the past two to three months. Another option is the fasting
                    blood glucose test, where you must fast for at least eight
                    hours before having your blood sugar checked.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    In some cases, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) may be
                    performed. This test measures how well your body handles
                    glucose after consuming a sweet drink. These tests are
                    crucial in determining whether you have diabetes type two or
                    another form of Diabetes.

                    Living with Diabetes type two requires ongoing management,
                    combining lifestyle changes and medications. The first line
                    of treatment often involves lifestyle adjustments, including
                    a healthy diet, weight loss, and regular exercise.

                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Losing just 5-7% of your body weight can improve your body's
                    ability to use insulin and help lower blood sugar levels.
                    Consulting with a registered dietitian can also help you
                    create a balanced eating plan that fits your needs.

                  <p className="mt-3">
                    For those who can't manage their Diabetes with lifestyle
                    changes alone, medications like Metformin, sulfonylureas,
                    and insulin may be necessary. Each case of diabetes type two
                    is unique, so it's essential to work closely with your
                    healthcare provider to find the best treatment plan for you.
