                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Green tea, like other genuine teas such as dark, white, and
                    oolong, is produced from the Camellia sinensis plant. It is
                    one of the few genuine teas that hasn't been excessively
                    processed. Green tea, similar to other real teas, contains
                    caffeine. It has been used in Ayurveda (Indian medicine) and
                    traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat various
                    conditions, ranging from fever to heart issues. <br />
                    <br />
                    Green Tea Benefits are widely acknowledged, including aiding
                    in weight loss, disease prevention, and blood pressure
                    reduction. It has also been linked to the prevention of
                    neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
                    Studies have shown that green tea helps reduce the risk of
                    cardiovascular disease by lowering LDL cholesterol and
                    improving blood flow. Green tea is a popular weight loss
                    supplement that helps you shed pounds by accelerating fat
                    oxidation. When green tea is added to your keto diet chart,
                    its effectiveness for weight loss increases significantly.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    While green tea is generally considered safe for adults,
                    there are a few Green Tea Side Effects to be aware of. Most
                    adverse effects of green tea can be avoided by consuming it
                    in moderation.{" "}

                    Green tea ought not to be devoured before night since it
                    contains caffeine, which can cause rest aggravations. It
                    contains the amino corrosive L-Theanine, which assists you
                    with remaining ready and centered. The ideal opportunity to
                    devour green tea is two hours before night since this is the
                    point at which your digestion is at its most minimal, and
                    green tea can assist you with supporting it.

                      <li>
                        To start, heat 2 cups of water in a medium pan over
                        medium-high hotness.

                        4 tablespoons crude sugar (or one more sugar of
                        decision) This delivers a better green tea, so overlook
                        this progression assuming that you need a more natural
                        and unsweet tea. Assuming you're utilizing some other
                        flavors or flavorings, right now is an ideal opportunity
                        to add them to the water.
