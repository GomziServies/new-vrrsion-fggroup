                    Cells are the building blocks of life, the basic unit of all
                    living organisms. From the simplest bacteria to the most
                    complex human body, cells play a fundamental role in every
                    living system. Although all living things are composed of
                    cells, there are two major types: prokaryotic cells and
                    eukaryotic cells. These cell types differ significantly in
                    their structure, function, and complexity. Understanding
                    these differences is essential to understanding life itself.
                    In this blog, we will explore the structure of prokaryotic
                    and eukaryotic cells, including their cell membranes,
                    nucleolus, cell organelles, and their respective functions.

                      At the most basic level, cells are categorized into two
                      types based on the presence or absence of a membrane-bound
                      nucleus:
                    </p>
                    <br />

                      <li>
                        Prokaryotic Cells: These cells are simpler, smaller, and
                        lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
                        Bacteria and archaea are prime examples of prokaryotic
                        organisms.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Eukaryotic Cells: These cells are more complex, larger,
                        and contain a true nucleus and numerous membrane-bound
                        organelles. Plants, animals, fungi, and protists are
                        composed of eukaryotic cells.

                    Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells share common
                    structures like the cell membrane, cytoplasm, DNA, and
                    ribosomes, but their internal organization and functional

                      Before diving into the structural details, it is essential
                      to recognize that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
                      likely evolved from a common ancestor, often referred to
                      as the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). LUCA existed
                      around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago and was a simple,
                      single-celled organism. Over billions of years, evolution
                      drove the diversification of LUCA's descendants into
                      prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

                      Prokaryotic cells are relatively simple in structure but

                      <li>
                        Cell Membrane: The cell membrane is the outer boundary
                        of the cell, responsible for regulating the entry and
                        exit of substances. In prokaryotes, the cell membrane is
                        typically surrounded by a rigid cell wall made of
                        peptidoglycan, which provides structure and protection.
                        The cell membrane itself is a phospholipid bilayer that
                        serves as a semi-permeable barrier, allowing essential
                        nutrients to enter while keeping harmful substances out.

                      <li>
                        Cytoplasm: The cytoplasm is the gel-like substance that
                        fills the interior of the cell. It is where all the
                        cellular processes take place. The cytoplasm houses
                        ribosomes, DNA, and enzymes necessary for cell
                        metabolism.

                      <li>
                        Nucleoid Region: Instead of a true nucleus, prokaryotic
                        cells contain a nucleoid region, where their genetic
                        material (DNA) is located. This DNA is typically a
                        single circular chromosome, which floats freely in the
                        cytoplasm.

                      <li>
                        Ribosomes: Prokaryotes contain ribosomes, which are the
                        sites of protein synthesis. Although smaller than
                        eukaryotic ribosomes, they perform the same essential
                        function—translating genetic information into proteins.

                        Additional Structures
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Plasmids: Small, circular DNA molecules that carry
                            genes beneficial for survival, such as antibiotic
                            resistance.

                    Eukaryotic cells are much more complex than prokaryotic
                    cells, with many specialized organelles that perform various
                    functions. Here are the key components of a eukaryotic cell:

                  <p>
                    Like prokaryotic cells, the cell membrane of a eukaryotic
                    cell is a phospholipid bilayer that regulates the movement
                    of substances in and out of the cell. However, in plant
                    cells, an additional cell wall made of cellulose surrounds
                    the cell membrane, providing extra support and structure.

                    The defining feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of
                    a nucleus, a membrane-bound organelle that contains the
                    cell's genetic material. The nucleus is the control center
                    of the cell, regulating growth, metabolism, and
                    reproduction.

                      <li>
                        Nucleolus: Inside the nucleus is the nucleolus, a dense
                        region where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized and
                        combined with proteins to form ribosomes. The nucleolus
                        is essential for protein synthesis and cell growth.

                    The cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells contains all the
                    organelles and is the site for most cellular activities. It
                    consists of cytosol (the liquid part) and various organelles
                    suspended within it.

                    Eukaryotic cells also have ribosomes, which can be found
                    floating freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough
                    endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ribosomes synthesize proteins by
                    reading mRNA sequences and linking amino acids together.

                    Eukaryotic cells contain numerous organelles, each with
                    specific roles that contribute to the overall functioning of
                    the cell. These organelles allow for compartmentalization,
                    increasing the efficiency and specialization of cellular
                    processes.

                    The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranous tubules
                    and sacs responsible for the synthesis, folding, and
                    transport of proteins and lipids. It is divided into two
                    types:

                    <li>
                      Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER): Studded with ribosomes,
                      the RER is involved in the synthesis of proteins that are
                      either secreted from the cell or integrated into the cell
                      membrane.

                    <li>
                      Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER): Lacking ribosomes, the
                      SER is involved in the synthesis of lipids, metabolism of
                      carbohydrates, detoxification of drugs and poisons, and
                      storage of calcium ions.
