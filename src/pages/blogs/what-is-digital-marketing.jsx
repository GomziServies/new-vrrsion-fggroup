                  <p className="mt-3">
                    The industry today is brimming with numerous services and
                    products where you, as a consumer, can easily lose track of
                    what you wanted in the first place. This is where Marketing
                    comes into play—it's the process of promoting a particular
                    product or service to the consumer market.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Now, one might wonder why there's a need to promote
                    something when the consumer is smart enough to know what
                    they want. However, the Marketing industry would disagree,
                    as its aim is to sell what they want you to buy.

                    The Evolution of Traditional Marketing
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                    Marketing as we traditionally know it, began booming in the
                    1950s when companies realized they needed to educate their
                    audience about their products or services. This led to the
                    rise of billboards, brochures, and pamphlets. Soon enough,
                    they discovered the public's attention toward sports and
                    movie stars, which led to celebrities being featured in ads.
                    Just like how we see Amitabh Bachchan in numerous ads today,
                    Marilyn Monroe was the most preferred star back then.

                    Well, that's enough about traditional Marketing. Let's shift
                    focus to the hot topic today—Digital Marketing. Any
                    Marketing effort that involves electronic devices or the
                    internet is classified as Digital Marketing.
                    <br />
                    <br /> You might think it's as simple as that, but there's
                    more than meets the eye. In reality, we've just scraped the
                    bark of a tree with a large trunk. Digital Marketing
                    consists of many components, and defining it with a
                    one-liner would do it no justice.

                    Social Media Marketing is one of the most important tools in
                    today's Digital Marketing world. Platforms like Facebook,
                    Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and
                    YouTube are extensively used by digital marketers. Whether
                    it's direct messages or clever graphics as posts, Social
                    Media Marketing is essential.
                    <br />

                    <br /> These platforms even offer paid advertising options,
                    where companies can "boost" their posts for increased
                    visibility. Social Media Marketing is akin to the billboards
                    of today, where witty, engaging content can capture
                    attention, making it a powerful tool for lead generation.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Brands have embraced meme culture, leveraging it to
                    increase product or service acceptance. To utilize Social
                    Media Marketing, companies must first determine where their
                    target audience is most active, and then proceed
                    accordingly. With billions of active users, Social Media
                    Marketing is here to stay, and its importance will only grow
                    in the future.

                    Those unskippable 30-second ads you encounter on YouTube?
                    That's Video Marketing in action. Companies pay platforms
                    like YouTube to showcase their ads before videos, targeting
                    millions of potential customers. With short, impactful
                    messages, Video Marketing can generate significant exposure
                    for brands.

                    their Marketing strategies, making their efforts more
                    effective. Analytics allow companies to cater to their
                    target audience in a way that drives conversions and
                    increases sales.
