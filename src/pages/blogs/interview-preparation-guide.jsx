                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Have you ever felt shaky legs, your heart racing as if it
                    might burst out of your chest, or even goosebumps and cold
                    sweats? That's the feeling of nervousness, and we've all
                    been there at some point, especially during our first
                    interview.
                    <br />
                    I clearly remember my first interview back in 2014. I was
                    still young and eager to land a part-time job after college.
                    I went for an interview at a fashion design institute, where
                    they frequently required male models. At that time, I was a
                    fitness model (yes, I had abs! Feel free to check out my
                    photos), having done a few freelance projects. However,
                    working in a formal setting was a whole different ballgame.
                    <br />
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div className="blog2 tabata-one">
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    So As I entered in the interview room same feeling of
                    nervousness started and I was highly frightened due to that.
                    They called me in I went and ask permission to sit,
                    <br />
                    <br /> Me (In Gujarati): Shu hu besi saku chu? English
                    translation (May I sit?)
                    <br />
                    <br /> Interview: Yes you can Gautam. Tell me something
                    about your self please.
                    <br />
                    <br /> “He didn't wait even for a second after I realize I
                    was there for an interview not for an chit-chat why should
                    he waste time after that”
                    <br />
                    <br /> Me: (Tried to speak in broken English) My name is
                    Dr.Gautam Jani, My school is.. My Father's name is etc...
                    <br />
                    <br /> Interviewer: I don't want to know about that tell me
                    something is not in your resume
                    <br />
                    <br /> Me: Stared the interviewer for 1 minute and roll my
                    eyes down, He understood I don't have anything to say.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Interviewer: So tell me why this industry and not
                    anything else? What are your goals in life, how you see your
                    self in 5 years.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Me: I thought and told me self the boy who stopped at
                    tell me more how can answer this question because that time
                    my goal was to take money and purchase the protein shake for
                    my bodybuilding nothing else.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Right most of young bodybuilder can relevant on that
                    because back in the time I didn't have any pocket money
                    although “ghar pew o concept hi nahi tha”
                    <br />
                    <br /> Again I rolled my eyes down that time I thought it is
                    finished I failed the interview and waiting for the answer
                    that please go and don't waste my time.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Interviewer: After thinking 5 mins and finished 2
                    phone calls in front of me said “Kal se kaam pea a jana aur
                    salary ki baat front desk pe kar lena”
                    <br />
                    <br /> Conclusion: Interview should not be a bigger deal
                    neither for you nor for the employer so chill a bit and feel
                    relaxed.

                    Listening is an art, and mastering it can make all the
                    difference in an interview. When you actively listen, your
                    brain processes more potential responses, allowing you to
                    provide thoughtful answers. Interrupting the interviewer may
                    come off as rude or overly dominant. Employers appreciate
                    candidates who listen well—it shows you are calm, cool, and
                    confident.

                    Honesty is crucial during an interview. Employers value
                    truthfulness, and lying can come back to haunt you. In
                    today's digital age, where everyone is connected, a false
                    claim about your previous salary, job role, or skills can

                    One of the most important steps in preparing for an
                    interview is doing your research. Look into the company's
                    background, values, and goals. Google, LinkedIn, and the
                    company's website are great resources for this. When you
                    understand the company's vision and objectives, you can
                    better align your answers to their needs.
