                        SGPT is a gift preponderantly within the liver and once
                        it's created in excess, it leaks into the blood. the

                        units/liter of body fluid. a really high level of SGPT
                        within the blood indicates some injury or problems

                          Severe knee pain can occur in people of all ages for a
                          variety of reasons. Knowing the cause of severe knee
                          pain can help a person seek treatment, relieve
                          symptoms, and regain mobility. The knee is the joint
                          between the upper and lower leg bones. It allows the
                          leg to bend and provides stability to support the
                          weight of the body. The knee supports movements such
                          as walking, running, crouching, jumping, and turning.

                      A fracture can cause sudden knee pain. A tibial plateau
                      fracture involves the tibia and patella. This type of

                      Fractures of the distal femur involve the lower part of
                      the thigh and the patella and cause similar symptoms. A
                      fractured patella may also occur, causing intense pain and
                      swelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fractures that involve these bones can occur from
                      traumatic injuries or simple falls.

                    <p className="mt-3">
                      Tendons connect your joints to your bones. Repetitive
                      activities (such as walking or running) can cause
                      inflammation and swelling of your tendons. This condition
                      is known as tendinitis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Knee tendinitis is quite common. Patellar tendinitis
                      (jumper's knee) and quadriceps tendinitis are specific
                      subtypes of this condition.

                    <p>
                      Tension, swelling, and dull pain are typical symptoms of
                      tendonitis in the knee. You may also not be able to move
                      the affected joint until you rest it.

                      Runner's knee refers to knee pain that starts behind or
                      around the kneecap. This condition is common in active

                    <p>
                      Symptoms include a dull throbbing behind the kneecap,

                      Runner's knee can also cause the knee to crack and crush.

                        Commonly injured ligaments in the knee are the anterior
                        cruciate ligament (ACL) and the medial collateral
                        ligament (MCL).

                      <p>
                        The PCL, LCL, and MPFL ligaments in the knee can also
                        tear. These ligaments connect the bones above and below
                        the patella.

                      <p>
                        It is not uncommon for one of these ligaments to tear,
                        especially in athletes. Sometimes you can pinpoint the
                        exact moment the tear occurred in your gear on the
                        soccer field or playing too much tennis.

                      <p>
                        Other times, the cause of the injury is less traumatic.
                        For example, hitting the knee at the wrong angle can
                        tear the ACL.

                      <p>
                        If you tear one of these ligaments, you will usually
                        hear a popping sound followed by swelling. This is
                        usually followed by severe knee pain. You may not be
                        able to move the joint without the help of a brace.

                        Sudden knee pain could indicate the onset of
                        osteoarthritis (OA). OA is the most common type of

                      <p>
                        Elderly people are most at risk of this condition,
                        especially athletes and people working in the
                        construction industry who often perform repetitive

                      <p>
                        Pain, tenderness, and inflammation of the knee are signs
                        that OA is starting to develop. In most cases, knee pain
                        does not appear suddenly. It is more likely to cause a
                        gradually increasing level of pain.

                      <p>
                        While OA can only affect one knee, it is more likely to

                        Bursae are fluid-filled sacs between your joints. The
                        bursae can become inflamed around the knees and cause

                        Repeated bending of the knees or bleeding into the bursa
                        can cause the sudden onset of bursitis symptoms. Knee

                        sound followed by an immediate sharp pain as well as
                        swelling. The affected knee may feel locked in place.

                        Infectious arthritis is an acute form of arthritis that
                        develops from the infected fluid surrounding your joint.

                    If your ulcer perforates (tears open), it becomes a bleeding
                    ulcer. This can cause the following symptoms:

                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Most ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).
                    It is a bacterial infection. Acids from the foods we eat can
                    make pain and discomfort worse. Long-term use of aspirin or
                    anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen) is also a common cause
                    of ulcers. Stress and spicy foods can make the ulcer worse.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    The ulcer diet is meant to help reduce the pain and
                    irritation that comes from a peptic ulcer, a painful ulcer
                    on the lining of the stomach, esophagus, or small intestine.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Food or drink does not cause or heal ulcers. However, some
                    foods help repair damaged tissue, while others irritate your
                    ulcer and compromise the natural protective lining of your
                    digestive tract.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adding an ulcer diet to your treatment can help you feel
                    better faster and possibly prevent another ulcer in the
                    future.

                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Many peptic ulcers are caused by the long-term use of
                    nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can
                    damage the lining of the digestive tract. Others are caused
                    by a bacterial infection known as Helicobacter pylori. The
                    ulcer diet adds foods with antibacterial properties and
                    compounds that promote healing in both cases.

                    <p className="mt-3">
                      These develop on the inside lining of the stomach and the
                      upper portion of the small intestine or esophagus. They
                      form when digestive juices damage the lining of the
                      stomach or intestine. These are most often caused by
                      inflammation after being infected by H.pylori and
                      long-term use of painkillers.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are three types of peptic ulcers:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Gastric ulcers</li>
                      <li>Esophageal ulcers</li>
                      <li>Duodenal ulcers</li>

                    <p className="mt-3">
                      These are open sores that develop on the outside of the
                      ankle, feet, toes, and heels. They develop from damage to
                      blood vessels due to insufficient blood flow to the
                      tissue. Arterial ulcers appear red, yellow, or black with
                      hairless skin and leg pain.

                    <p className="mt-3">
                      It is the most common type of leg ulcer and often forms on
                      the leg, below the knee, and on the inside of the ankle.
                      They occur as a result of damaged veins that are caused by
                      insufficient blood flow back to the heart. A person may
                      also have inflammation, swelling, itchy skin, scabs, and a
                      discharge.

                    <p className="mt-3">
                      These are small sores or lesions that develop in the mouth
                      or at the base of the gums. They are also known as canker
                      sores. Mouth ulcers are caused by biting the inside of the
                      face, harsh brushing, food allergies, hormonal changes,
                      vitamin deficiencies, bacterial infections, and other
                      serious illnesses.

                    <p className="mt-3">
                      These develop on the genitals including the vagina, penis,
                      anus, or surrounding areas. Genital ulcers usually occur
                      as a result of trauma, inflammatory conditions, sexually
                      transmitted infections, or allergic reactions to skin care
                      products. They are accompanied by a rash, pain, itching,
                      swelling of the nodes in the groin, and fever.
